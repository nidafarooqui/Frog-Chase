==========

A 2D maze game demo about a frog being chased by a pelican. The aim of this game is to introduce 4 or 5 year old children to the world of programming through simple logics. The frog moves after you press the number of directional arrow keys in sequence and then press enter. This game also has three or more doors of which one leads straight to the pelican and the other two lead you away from the pelican and closer to home.
